The goal of this project is to develop a plugin for a NPC, which would have following functionalities:

Ability to grow and harvest plants in a given area
Ability to mine designated Resources
Ability to deposit its inventory contents into a specified chest
Ability to interact with passive and hostile NPCs
Ability to build Predetermined buildings
Ability to follow the player
Ability to reproduce

The NPC could be affected by hunger. 
The NPC could have several modes which would affect its behaviour and could be toggled by writing commands in the game chat, editing config files or by using a specially created GUI.
One of the modes could allow it to function, spread and reproduce without interacting with players at all.
Chunks close to the NPC should remain active even if there are no players nearby.
NPC could also provide emotional support for players by sleeping next to them.
